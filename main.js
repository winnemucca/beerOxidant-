// @desc International Bitterness Unit
//  IBU scale starts at 0 and is, in theory, open-ended at the top
//  I've seen "110 IBU" mentioned as the most bitter a beer can get, but I have yet to find an official source for that
//  Budweiser, has 10 IBUs.
//  average IPA has between 40 and 60
//  Double IPAs and other highly hopped styles clock in between 60 and 100
